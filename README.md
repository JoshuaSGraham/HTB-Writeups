In this repository you can find my write ups for Hack The Box machines\([https://www.hackthebox.eu/home](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home)\) that are styled in a root 2 boot challenge. Where you as an attacker have to gain user access and then administrator or root access to the machine by doing this you are able to submit codes to the website to gain points. 

Here is my HTB profile \([https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/120679](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/120679)\)
