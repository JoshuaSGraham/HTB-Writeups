In this repository you can find my write ups for Hack The Box machines\([https://www.hackthebox.eu/home](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home)\) that are styled in a root 2 boot challenge. Where you as an attacker have to gain user access and then administrator or root access to the machine by doing this you are able to submit codes to the website to gain points. 

I am making this respoisotry of HTB writeups to help me create notes on all of the boxes that I complete in preparation for taking the OSCP soon. This is to help mine and maybe others learning experience to be better. In each boxes writeup I hope to explain my thought process and how I actually rooted each machine. 

Here is my HTB profile if you would like to see it \([https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/120679](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/120679)\)
